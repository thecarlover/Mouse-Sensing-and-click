## Introduction

The Mouse Click by Hand project allows users to control mouse clicks by utilizing hand gestures. The project uses OpenCV with MediaPipe to detect hand movements and PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse clicks. This can be particularly useful for hands-free interactions with computers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thecarlover/Mouse-Sensing-and-click.git
   cd Mouse-Sensing-and-click

2. Requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run
   ```bash
   python mousecontrol.py
## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is properly connected.
2. Run the mousecontrol.py script.
3. Perform hand gestures in front of the camera to simulate mouse clicks.
